## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Responsive web design

### What I learned

Working on real world projects was a threshold  for me.
I am happy that FronEndMontor give us the chance to evaluate our skills.
I leaned the use of the browser dev tools, css flex, hosting the project on github Pages, and wrinting md files and much more.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on Css grid, hsl colors...

### Useful resources

- [Working with a Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) - This helped me reduce the working time . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward in all my projects.
- [markdownlint : Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) - This is an amazing extention which helped me Preview Md files. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
